Commando is a shoot and run, vertically scrolling arcade game released in 1985. It’s one of the most influenceable games of this genre. This game was realized in various home consoles and home computers.

Our group(Sandra Alvrez, Aleix Castillo, Guillem Costa and Aleix Gabarró) is going to make a full level 1-1 recreated.
Every member of the team had his part of the work, event that everyone helped in the code of the game.
