The plot is about a soldier named Super Joe who starts being dropped off in a jungle by helicopter, and has to fight his way out singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers. In the game, you have a sub-machine gun with unlimited ammunition as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. Use wisely your skills if you don't want to be killed and DESTROY THE ENEMY ARMY!!!
